# libxml2_fuzzers
Fuzzing test harnesses for the GNOME libxml2 library.

This git repository is a temporary placeholder for
additional libxml2 fuzzer harnesses other than those 
available in the oss-fuzz/projects/libxml2 directory
of the oss-fuzz git repo.

The idea is to leverage these fuzzers until they
are upstreamed to GNOME libxml2 repo at which time
they are expected to be automatically picked up
without the involvement of any third-party software
 such as the code in this repo.
